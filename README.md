# Jittering Model

The Paper directory in this repository contains all the code used to generate the plots in arXiv:25XX.XXXXX.  If you have any questions, please contact Saarik Kalia (kalias@umn.edu).

The Paper directory contains three subdirectories:
- Computations: code used to generate data files for certain plots
- Data: all data generated by code in Computations
- Figures: code to plot all figures

The figures are generated by the following codes:
- Fig. 1: jittering.py (with three different parameter settings)
- Fig. 2: comparison.py
- Fig. 3: fjsplot.py and tausplot.py (using datafiles fjs_DMP.npz, fjs_gaussian.npz, taus_DMP.npz, and taus_gaussian.npz generated by fjs.py and taus.py)
- Fig. 4: phase.py
- Fig. 5: histplot.py (using datafiles hist_DMP.npz and hist_gaussian.npz generated by hist.py)
- Fig. 6: corrplot.py (using datafile corr.npz generated by corr.py)
- Fig. 7: sfplot, snrplot, and sxplot (using datafile schi.npz generated by schi.py; schi.npz not included in repository)
